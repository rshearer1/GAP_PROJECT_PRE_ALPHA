## üéÆ How to Test in Roblox Studio

### Step 1: Open Device Emulation

1. In Roblox Studio, go to **Test** tab
2. Click **Device** dropdown
3. Select different devices to test:

```
‚úÖ Test these views:
- Desktop (1920x1080)
- Laptop (1366x768)
- Tablet (768x1024)
- Phone (375x667) Portrait
- Phone (667x375) Landscape
- Console (1920x1080 with safe zones)
```

### Step 2: Play Test

1. Click **Play** (F5) in Studio
2. Open the debug panel with **T** key
3. Click **"üêæ Hatch Random Pet"** to create some pets
4. Click the **üêæ button** on the right side of screen
5. Verify the Pet Panel appears centered

### Step 3: Visual Checks

**Pet Toggle Button (üêæ):**
- [ ] Button is visible on right side of screen
- [ ] Button is square (not stretched)
- [ ] Button size is between 40x40 and 70x70
- [ ] Emoji is centered and readable
- [ ] Button has rounded corners

**Pet Panel:**
- [ ] Panel is centered on screen
- [ ] Panel maintains aspect ratio (slightly taller than wide)
- [ ] Panel size is between 300x400 and 600x800
- [ ] Background is dark gray (#1E1E28)
- [ ] Panel has rounded corners

**Title ("My Pets"):**
- [ ] Title is readable (14-22px range)
- [ ] Title is bold and white
- [ ] Title is left-aligned with padding

**Pet List:**
- [ ] Pets display in scrollable list
- [ ] Pet names are readable (10-16px range)
- [ ] Bonuses show in purple on right side
- [ ] Text scales with panel size

### Step 4: Resize Testing

In Studio, manually resize the window:

1. **Make window smaller** (simulate laptop/tablet)
   - Panel should shrink but stay readable
   - Minimum size should be 300x400
   - Text should remain legible

2. **Make window larger** (simulate 4K screen)
   - Panel should grow but not become huge
   - Maximum size should be 600x800
   - Text should not become oversized

3. **Change aspect ratio** (simulate portrait/landscape)
   - Panel should stay centered
   - Button should stay on right edge

## üì± Device-Specific Tests

### Mobile (Small Screen)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Pet button: 40x40px (minimum size kicks in)
- Panel: 300x400px (minimum size kicks in)
- Text: 10-14px (readable on phone)
- No UI elements off-screen
- No overlapping with other buttons

**How to Test:**
```
1. Device ‚Üí Phone (375x667)
2. Play test
3. Check button tap target is large enough
4. Check text is readable without zooming
```

### Tablet (Medium Screen)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Pet button: ~50x50px (natural scale)
- Panel: ~350x500px (scaled proportionally)
- Text: 12-16px (comfortable reading)
- Good spacing and padding

**How to Test:**
```
1. Device ‚Üí Tablet (768x1024)
2. Play test
3. Check UI feels balanced (not too small/large)
```

### Desktop/Console (Large Screen)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Pet button: 50-70px (scaled up, capped at max)
- Panel: 480-600px (scaled up, capped at max)
- Text: 16-22px (large but not oversized)
- No wasted space, comfortable reading distance

**How to Test:**
```
1. Device ‚Üí Desktop (1920x1080)
2. Play test
3. Check UI doesn't look tiny
4. Check text is crisp and readable
```

## üêõ Common Issues to Watch For

### Issue 1: Button Too Small on Mobile
**Symptom:** Can't tap pet button on phone
**Fix:** Check UISizeConstraint.MinSize is at least 40x40

### Issue 2: Panel Too Large on Desktop
**Symptom:** Panel fills entire screen
**Fix:** Check UISizeConstraint.MaxSize is set to 600x800

### Issue 3: Text Unreadable
**Symptom:** Text is blurry or too small
**Fix:** Check UITextSizeConstraint min/max values

### Issue 4: Panel Not Centered
**Symptom:** Panel appears off to one side
**Fix:** Verify AnchorPoint = 0.5, 0.5 and Position = 0.5, 0, 0.5, 0

### Issue 5: Button Stretched/Squished
**Symptom:** Pet button is not square
**Fix:** Check UIAspectRatioConstraint.AspectRatio = 1

## üîß Quick Fixes

If you find issues, common adjustments:

**Button Too Small:**
```lua
toggleConstraint.MinSize = Vector2.new(50, 50)  -- Increase from 40
```

**Panel Too Large:**
```lua
panelConstraint.MaxSize = Vector2.new(500, 700)  -- Decrease from 600x800
```

**Text Too Small:**
```lua
nameTextConstraint.MinTextSize = 12  -- Increase from 10
```

**Panel Not Centered:**
```lua
panel.AnchorPoint = Vector2.new(0.5, 0.5)  -- Verify this
panel.Position = UDim2.new(0.5, 0, 0.5, 0)  -- Verify this
```
